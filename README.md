            <h1>Philip Wilkinson</h1>
            <h2>Smart Cities and Urban Analytics MSc student</h2>

            <p>I am currently studying for my Master's in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics within the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis at UCL. I am interested in understand how technology and data science can aid our understanding of how the built environment works and how we can then improve that to make everyone's lives better. </p>
        
            <p>My existing pieces of work can be found through the links below, including my submission for Urban Systems Theory, Quantitative Methods and Geographic Information Systems and Science. I am looking forward to expanding on these projects, as well as developing new ones as my knowledge of data science and its applications grow.</p>

          <h3> Geographic Information Systems and Science </h3>
          <img src="./images/thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="A picture of a panda">
          <p>This project sought to understand, in very basic terms, where can the dividing line between the North and South of the UK be drawn, and to what extent this affects quality of life. This project developed through my desire to understand the North/South Divide in the UK.</p>

          <h3> Quantitative Methods </h3>
          <img src="./images/thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="A picture of a panda">
          <p> Here I utilised multiple linar regression techniques, following in the path of exitsing literature, to understand the potential effects that neighbourhood characteristics may have on learning outcomes. </p>

          <h3> Urban Systems Theory </h3>
          <img src="./images/thumbnail-1.jpg" alt="A picture of a panda">
          <p> This module required the production of a research proposal that dealth with some of the topic raised in the course. Here I decided to put forward a proposal that would seek to explore the literature surrounding Richard Florida's creative class, and compare whether and to what extent, the social divides that have been suggested to arise as a result of placemaking for the creative class, extend into physical divides. </p>
