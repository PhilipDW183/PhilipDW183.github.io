								<h2>Introduction</h2>
								<p>
									I am currently a Doctoral Researcher at the Centre for Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL,
									working on modelling flows of loyalty card data and total revenue to grocery retailers across the UK.
									I am interested in exploring how Data Science and Software Engineering can be used to support our
									understanding of the built environment and how we can use this to improve the way in which
									we interact with the city around us. I have expeirence working with a variety of different 
									technologies including Python, React, Java and Javascript and have created websites,
									data science projects and Android Apps. Below you will be able to see some of the works
									that I have been doing in my spare time.

										UK Transport Profiles
									</h2>
									<p> 
										This project was created as part of my MSc in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics
										that was subsequently moved onto AWS. This website was developed as part of a 
										distributed team with the aim of identiyfing different transport profiles across
										the UK by their transport mode usage and accessibility. This was achieved using 
										publicly available data on travel to work in the 2011 census on data on different
										transport modes accessibility. The website is currently hosted on an AWS lightsail
										instance, for which Python was used for the data Analysis, SQL is used to host the 
										transport data, and the front-end being built with JTML, css
										and Javascript. The website, along with further details of the project

									Development Planning Unit Alumni Website
								</h2>
								<p>
									Myself and a colleage were commissioned to produce an alumni website for the 
									Development Planning Unit, UCL, to allow their alumni to interact with each 
									other on a dedicated platform. For this I developed a continuous pipeline that 
									updated the website data based on a firebase database of new alumni sign-ups using
									GitHub action, and created a dashboard that allowed the department to accept or
									reject new users alongside visualise website usage statistics. This was created
									over a period of two weeks where the following tasks were completed:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										A python script was created that geocoded the locational information of users into a GeoJSON
										that could be served up to the website to use in the Mapbox visualisation.
									</li>
									<li>
										A GitHub action was set up to load in new data from the firebase database every 12 hours into the 
										Python script, which would then create a refreshed GeoJSON
									</li>
									<li>
										A Plotly Dash dashboard was created and hosted on Heroku that would give the department the ability to 
										visualise usage statistics including active users and where they are located. Additional functionality
										included a downloadable table that contained contact information for users who wished to be included on 
										regular corresponence, and an interactive table that provided the department the ability to accept or reject
										users based on their profile information which would then feed into the GitHub Actions work in that only
										verified users would be displayed on the maps created
									</li>
									
								</ul>
								<p>
									The website has been successfull running for the past year and successfully hosts over 300 active users.

								<h2>Hackathons</h2>
								<p>
									Since starting my Masters in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics in 2019, and throughout the PhD, I have
									participated in, and been ranked, in several hackathons. These include:
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<b>Hex Cambridge (2021)</b>: My team competed in Hex Cambridge desigining a website 
										to be able to identify and map hostile architecture based on a submission 
										and computer vision tagging algorithm. In this project I was responsible for 
										deployment of the Flask application to the Google Cloud Platform and
										integration with the AdAstra Database. We were awarded the Wolfram Award and 
										Best use of DataStax Astra. Our submissino can be found on the MLH website 
										<a href = https://devpost.com/software/hacktheurban-space?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects>
										here</a>.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>CASA Hackathon (2021)</b>: My team competed in the CASA-Hackathon to geocode and analyse
										residential address data for Dubai for JLL. Our team, on geocoding over 90% of the 
										addresses, was awardded first place. After geocoding the data, we began to explore the data 
										and performed a cluster analysis of sales over the 10 year period of the data. I was responsible 
										for geocoding the data using Open Street Maps and performing the clustering analysis. 
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Citadel Data Open (2022) World Finals</b>: Our team competed at the Citidal Data Open world Finals
										in examining plastic pollution across the world. Out solution utilised a spatial interaction model solution
										to determine the potential for changes in plastic trade across the world and hence identify future hotspots
										for increased plastic pollution based on existing plastic pollution policies. Our final report and notebook
										can be found <a href = "https://github.com/gorostuck/citadel-open-data">here</a>. I was responsible for developing
										and applying the spatial inetraction model to the data to predict plastic trade flows in 2030.

								<h2>Technologies and Skills</h2>
								<p>Below you will find descriptions and links to some of the tools and skills 
									that I routinely use and that I am comfortable with. 
								</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3><a href = "https://github.com/PhilipDW183">GitHub</a></h3>
									<p>Here you will find a link to my GitHub account and my repositories for my differnt projects.
										I have used this for version control for my projects, I manage the UCL Data Science Society
										GitHub page, I have worked collaboratively in large teams using GitHub and I have used GitHub
										Actions to create a continous workflow for the DPU Alumni website. I have been a Postgraduate
										Teaching Assistant on the Introduction to Programming Module, which teaches Python, on the Smart
										Cities and Urban Analytics MSc.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-laptop">
									<h3>Python</h3>
									<p>Python is the dominant language that I work in using libraries such as: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, 
										Plotly, SciKit-Learn, Statsmodels and Geopandas. Most of work tends to involve geospatial data so geospatial
										libraries such as Geopandas, PySal and others tend to be used. 
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>SQL</h3>
									<p>SQL is a language that was used for Transport Profiles across the UK project to deliver 
										the flows to the map page. I also helped teach this language on the Spatial Data Capture, Storage 
										and Analysis Module for the Smart Cities and Urban Analytics MSc, along with developing a SQL
										workshop for the UCL Data Science Society. 
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-headphones-alt">
									<h3>AWS / Microsoft Azure</h3>
									<p>I have familiarity with AWS as the UK Transpot Profiles website is currently hosted
										on an AWS lightsail instance which I continue to manage on behalf of my group. I also
										recently received my Azure Data Fundametals Certificate for Azure.
									</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon solid fa-code">
									<h3>HTML, CSS, Javascript, R</h3>
									<p>These are all technologies that I encountered in my MSc Smart Cities and Urban Analytics
										for which I recieved a distinction in all modules, including those using these technologies
										in their final assessment. While I do not currently use these in my workflows, I am familiar with
										them and I could continue to develop these skills in the future.
