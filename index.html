            <h2> About Me </h2>

            <p> Hello, my name is Philip Wilkinson. I am currently studying for a PhD at the Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis, UCL, after previously completing a Masters in Smart Cities and Urban Analytics in the same department. I am currently working on on a variety of data science projects that have explored the ways in which the built environment can influence social, economic and political outcomes and developing my coding experience and portfolio. </p>
        
            <p>My interests lie in being able to understand how the physical built environment shapes our social, economic and political interactions and can lead to diverse life outcomes. This includes the way in which new technologies or analytical techniques can help inform this understanding and hence help us shape the built environment to the benefit of all.</p>

          <h3> Differences in UK transport profiles </h3>
          <p> This workpiece produced a website, in conjunction with a team of students on the Master's program, that presented an analysis of travel to work pattens in the UK using the 2011 census data. The website was originally hosted on the UCL internal server but now currently resides on a AWS Lightsail instance, utilising Apache and NodeJs.</p>
